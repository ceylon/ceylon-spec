    <para>A Ceylon program executes in a virtual machine environment, either:</para>

    <para>In future, other virtual machine architectures may be supported.</para>
    
    <para>Despite the obvious differences between the respective languages that these 
    virtual machines were designed for, they share very much in common in terms of 
    runtime semantics, including common notions such as object identity, primitive 
    value types, exceptions, garbage collection, dynamic dispatch, and pass by 
    reference.</para>
    
    <para>Ceylon abstracts away many of the differences between these platforms, and
    reuses what is common between them. Inevitably there are some differences that
    can't reasonably be hidden from the Ceylon program, and the programmer must take 
    these differences into consideration.</para>
    
    <para>In Ceylon, every value is a reference to an instance of a class, except
    within a <literal>dynamic</literal> block, where a value with no type may be
    a reference to an object which is not an instance of a class.</para> 
    
    <comment><para>Note: the semantics of objects without classes is platform-dependent
    and outside the scope of this specification.</para></comment>

        <para>An <emphasis>object</emphasis> is a unique identifier, together with a 
        reference to a class, its type arguments, and a persistent value for each 
        reference declared by the class (including inherited references). The object 
        is said to be an <emphasis>instance</emphasis> of the class.</para>
        
        <para>A <emphasis>value</emphasis> is a reference to an object (a copy of its 
        unique identifier). At a particular point in the execution of the program, 
        every reference of every object that exists, and every initialized reference 
        of every function, getter, setter, or initializer that is currently executing 
        has a value. Furthermore, every time an expression is executed, it produces a 
        value.</para>
        
        <para>Two values are said to be <emphasis>identical</emphasis> if they are
        references to the same object&mdash;if they hold the same unique identifier. 
        The program may determine if two values of type <literal>Identifiable</literal> 
        are identical using the <literal>&identical;</literal> operator defined in
        <xref linkend="operatordefinition"/>. It may not directly obtain the unique 
        identifier (which is a purely abstract construct). The program has no way of 
        determining the identity of a value which is not of type 
        <literal>Identifiable</literal>.</para>
        
        <para>Given a value, the program may determine if the referenced object is
        <emphasis>assignable to a certain type</emphasis> using the <literal>is</literal> 
        operator. The object is assignable to the given type if the applied type formed 
        by its class and type arguments is a subtype of the given type according to the 
        type system defined in <xref linkend="typesystem"/>. (Therefore, the Ceylon 
        runtime must be capable of reasoning about subtyping.)</para>
        
        <para>Invocation of a function or instantiation of a class results in execution 
        of the function body or class initializer with parameter values that are copies 
        of the value produced by executing the argument expressions of the invocation, 
        and a reference to the receiving instance that is a copy of the value produced 
        by executing the receiver expression. The value produced by the invocation 
        expression is a copy of the value produced by execution of the 
        <literal>return</literal> directive expression.</para>
        
        <programlisting>Person myself(Person me) { return me; }
Person p = ...;

this.semaphore = s;
assert (semaphore&identical;s); //assertion never fails</programlisting>
        
        <para>A new object is produced by execution of a class instantiation expression.
        The Ceylon compiler guarantees that if execution of a class initializer terminates
        with no uncaught exception, then every reference of the object has been initialized
        with a well-defined persistent value. The value of a reference is initialized for 
        the first time by execution of a specifier or assignment expression. Every class 
        instantiation expression results in an object with a new unique identifier shared 
        by no other existing object. The object exists from the point at which execution 
        of its initializer terminates. <emphasis>Conceptually</emphasis>, the object exists 
        until execution of the program terminates.</para>
        
        <para>In practice, the object exists at least until the point at which it is not 
        reachable by recursively following references from any function, getter, setter, 
        or initializer currently being executed, or from an expression in a statement 
        currently being executed. At this point, its persistent values are no longer 
        accessible to expressions which subsequently execute and the object may be 
        destroyed by the virtual machine. There is no way for the program to determine
        that an object has been destroyed by the virtual machine (Ceylon does not support 
        finalizers).</para>

            <title>Value type optimizations</title>
            
            <para>As a special exception to the rules defined above, the compiler is permitted 
            to emit bytecode or compiled JavaScript that produces a new instance of certain 
            types in the module <literal>ceylon.language</literal> without execution of the 
            initializer of the class, whenever any expression is evaluated. These types are: 
            <literal>Integer</literal>, <literal>Float</literal>, <literal>Character</literal>, 
            <literal>Range</literal>, <literal>Entry</literal>, <literal>String</literal>, 
            <literal>Array</literal>, and <literal>Tuple</literal>. Furthermore, it is permitted 
            to use such a newly-produced instance as the value of the expression, as long as the 
            newly-produced instance is equal to the value expected according to the rules above, 
            as determined using the <literal>==</literal> operator.</para>
        
            <para>Therefore, the types listed above directly extend <literal>Object</literal>
            instead of <literal>Basic</literal>, and are not <literal>Identifiable</literal>.</para>
            
            <comment><para>Note: this does no justice at all to our compiler. Actually the 
            compiler infrastructure already supports value type optimization for user-defined 
            types, though we have not yet exposed this functionality as part of the language.

        <para>Ceylon programs are organized into bodies, as defined in

        <para>The statements and non-lazy specifiers that directly occur in a body are 
        executed sequentially in the lexical order in which they occcur. Execution of a

        terminates when the last statement or non-lazy specifier of the body finishes 
        executing, or when a control directive that terminates the block is executed, 
        or when an exception is thrown by an evaluation, assignment, invocation, or 
        instantiation.</para>
        
        <section>
            <title>Frames</title>
        
            <para>When execution of a body begins, a <emphasis>frame</emphasis> is created.
            For each reference whose declaration directly occurs in the body, the frame
            has a value, which may or may not be initialized. The value may be initialized
            or assigned during execution of the body.</para>
            
            <para>We can visualize a frame as a list of reference declarations with optional
            values. For example, a frame with an initialized reference named 
            <literal>language</literal> and an uninitialized reference named 
            <literal>count</literal> would be written like this:</para>
            
            <programlisting>{ String language = "ceylon"; Integer count; }</programlisting>
            
            <para>While a body is executing, all values held in the frame are considered 
            accessible. An evaluation, assignment, invocation, or instantiation may result 
            in a pause in execution of the body while the called getter, setter, function, 
            or class is executed or instantiated. However, the frame associated with the 
            calling body is retained and values held in the frame are still considered 
            accessible. When execution of the body resumes, the frame is restored.</para>
            
            <para>When execution of a body terminates, the frame may or may not become
            inaccessible. In the case of a class body, if the initializer terminates with
            no thrown exception, the frame and its values become a new instance of the 
            class, are associated with the newly created unique identifier, and remain 
            accessible while this object is itself accessible. In the case of any other 
            kind of body, or in the case that an initializer throws an exception, the 
            frame and its values may remain accessible if:</para>

        into a <emphasis>comprehension instance</emphasis>. A comprehension instance 
        is not considered a value in the sense of <xref linkend="objectinstancesidentity"/>. 
        Instead, it is a stream of values, each produced by evaluating the expression 
        clause of the comprehension.</para>
        
        <para>A comprehension consists of a series of clauses. Each clause of a 
        comprehension, except for the expression clause that terminates the list of 
        clauses, produces a stream of <emphasis>frames</emphasis>. A frame is a set 
        of values for iteration variables and condition variables declared by the 
        clause and its parent clauses.</para>

        the parent clause. The lifecycle of comprehension frames reflects this model.

            For each frame produced by the parent clause, and for each value
            produced by the source stream of the child clause, the child clause
            produces a frame consisting of the parent clause frame extended

        <para>Neither this specification nor the module <literal>ceylon.language</literal>
        provide any facility to initiate or control concurrent execution of a program

        <para>In this scenario, the execution of a Ceylon program is governed by the rules 
        laid out by the Java programming language's execution model (Chapter 17 of the Java 
        Language Specification). Ceylon references belonging to a class or interface are 
        considered <emphasis>fields</emphasis> in the sense of the JLS. Any such refence
        not explicitly declared <literal>variable</literal> is considered a 
        <emphasis>final field</emphasis>. Evaluation of a reference is considered a 
        <emphasis>use</emphasis> operation, and assignment to or specification of a variable
        reference is considered an <emphasis>assign</emphasis> operation, again in terms of 
        the JLS.</para>
