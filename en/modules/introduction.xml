    <para>This document defines the syntax and semantics of the Ceylon language.
    The intended audience includes compiler implementors, interested parties
    who wish to contribute to the evolution of the language, and experienced 
    developers seeking a precise definition of language constructs. However, in
    light of the newness of the language, we will begin with an overview of the
    main features of the language and SDK. A brief introduction to programming 
    in the language may be found at the following address:</para>

        <title>Language overview</title>
    
        <para>
        Ceylon is a general-purpose programming  language featuring a syntax similar 
        to Java and C#. It is imperative, statically-typed, block-structured, 
        object-oriented, and higher-order. By <emphasis>statically-typed</emphasis>, 
        we mean that the compiler performs extensive type checking, with the help of 
        type annotations that appear in the code. By <emphasis>object-oriented</emphasis>, 
        we mean that the language supports user-defined types and features a nominative 
        type system where a type is a set of named attributes and operations, and that 
        it supports inheritance and subtype polymorphism. By <emphasis>higher-order</emphasis>, 
        we mean that every referenceable program element (every attribute, every 
        operation, and every type) is also a value. By <emphasis>block-structured</emphasis>, 
        we mean to say that the language features lexical scoping and an extremely 
        regular recursive syntax for declarations and statements.
        </para>
        
        <para>
        Ceylon improves upon the Java language and type system to reduce verbosity 
        and increase typesafety compared to Java and C#. Ceylon encourages a more 
        functional, somewhat less imperative style of programming, resulting in code 
        which is easier to reason about, and easier to refactor.

            Ceylon programs execute in any standard Java Virtual Machine or on any
            JavaScript virtual machine, and take advantage of the memory management and 
            concurrency features of the virtual machine in which they execute. Ceylon
            programs are packaged into <emphasis>modules</emphasis> with well-defined
            inter-module dependencies, and always execute inside a runtime environment 
            with module isolation.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            The Ceylon compiler is able to compile Ceylon code that calls Java classes or 
            interfaces, and Java code that calls Ceylon classes or interfaces. JavaScript
            code is able to interact with Ceylon classes and functions compiled to JavaScript. 
            Via a special <emphasis>dynamic</emphasis> mode, code written in Ceylon may call
            functions defined natively in JavaScript.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            Moreover, Ceylon provides its own native SDK as a replacement for the Java 
            platform class libraries. Certain SDK modules depend upon services available
            only on the Java platform. Other SDK modules, including the core 
            <emphasis>language module</emphasis>, are cross-platform and may also be used 
            in a JavaScript virtual machine.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            Finally, the language supports the development of cross-platform modules that
            contain platform-specific implementation code, via the <literal>native</literal>
            annotation.

        <title>Type system</title>
        
        <para>
        Ceylon, like Java and C#, features a hybrid type system with both subtype 
        polymorphism and parameteric polymorphism. A type is either a stateless 
        <emphasis>interface</emphasis>, a stateful <emphasis>class</emphasis>, a 
        <emphasis>type parameter</emphasis>, or a <emphasis>union</emphasis> or 
        <emphasis>intersection</emphasis> of other types. A class, interface, or 
        type parameter may be defined as a subtype of another type. A class or 
        interface may declare type parameters, which abstract the definition of the 
        class or interface over all types which may be substituted for the type 
        parameters.
        </para>
        
        <para>
        Like C#, and unlike Java, Ceylon's type system is fully reified. In 
        particular, generic type arguments are reified, eliminating many problems 
        that result from type erasure in Java.
        </para>
        
        <para>
        There are no primitive types or arrays in Ceylon&mdash;every Ceylon type can 
        be represented within the language itself. So all values are instances of the 
        type hierarchy root <literal>Anything</literal>, which is a class. However, 
        the Ceylon compiler is permitted to optimize certain code to take advantage 
        of the optimized performance of primitive types on the Java or JavaScript VM.
        </para>
        
        <para>
        Furthermore, all types inferred or even computed internally by the Ceylon 
        compiler are expressible within the language itself. Within the type system,
        <emphasis>non-denoteable</emphasis> types simply do not arise. The type system 
        is based upon computation of <emphasis>principal types</emphasis>. There is no 
        legal expression which does not have a unique principal type expressible within 
        the language. The principal type of an expression is a subtype of all other 
        types to which the expression could be soundly assigned.
        </para>
        
        <section id="mixininheritance">
            <title>Mixin inheritance</title>
            
            <para>
            Ceylon supports a restricted form of multiple inheritance, often called 
            <emphasis>mixin inheritance</emphasis>. A class must extend exactly one other 
            class. But a class or interface may satisfy (extend or implement) an arbitrary 
            number of interfaces.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            Classes hold state and define logic to initialize that state when the class is 
            instantiated. A concrete class is a class that contains only concrete member 
            definitions. Concrete classes may be directly instantiated. An abstract class 
            may have <emphasis>formal</emphasis> (unimplemented) member declarations. 
            Abstract classes may not be instantiated.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            Interfaces may define concrete and formal members, but may not hold state 
            (references to other objects) or initialization logic. This restriction helps 
            eliminate the problems traditionally associated with multiple inheritance. 
            Ceylon never performs any kind of "linearization" of the supertypes of a type. 
            Interfaces may not be directly instantiated.

            <para>
            Ceylon does not feature Java-style enumerated types as a first-class construct. 
            Instead, any abstract type may specify its <emphasis>cases</emphasis>&mdash;an
            enumerated list of instances and/or subtypes. This facility is used to simulate 
            both enumerated types and functional-style algebraic sum types.

            <para>
            A closely related feature is support for <emphasis>self types</emphasis> and 
            <emphasis>type families</emphasis>. A self type is a type parameter of an 
            abstract type (like <literal>Comparable</literal>) which represents the type of 
            a concrete instantiation (like <literal>String</literal>) of the abstract type,
            within the definition of the abstract type itself.

            <para>
            In a type family, the self type of a type is declared not by the type itself, 
            but by a containing type which groups together a set of related types.

            <title>Simplified generics</title>
            
            <para>
            Ceylon doesn't have raw types, implicit bounds, or wildcard capture. And the 
            Ceylon compiler never even uses any kind of "non-denotable" type to reason 
            about the type system. So generics-related error messages are understandable 
            to humans.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            Ceylon features <emphasis>declaration-site variance</emphasis>. A type parameter 
            may be marked as covariant or contravariant by the class or interface that 
            declares the parameter.

            In order to support interoperation with Java, Ceylon also features 
            Java-style <emphasis>use-site variance</emphasis>, with a much cleaner syntax
            than Java's. A type argument may be marked as covariant or contravariant.

            <para>
            Ceylon has a somewhat more expressive system of generic type constraints with 
            a cleaner, more regular syntax. The syntax for declaring constraints on a type 
            parameter looks very similar to a class or interface declaration. A type 
            parameter may have upper bound type constraints or even 
            <emphasis>enumerated bounds</emphasis>.

            Union and intersection types provide some of the benefits of structural 
            ("duck") typing, within the confines of a nominative type system, and 
            therefore certain Ceylon idioms are reminiscent of code written in

            Union and intersection types underly the whole system of principal typing 
            in Ceylon, forming the foundation for type inference and flow-sensitive 
            typing. In particular, they play a central role in generic type argument 
            inference. For example, the following expression has type 
            <literal>HashMap&lt;String,Integer|Float&gt;</literal>:

            Type aliases and type inference help reduce the verbosity of code which

            Local <emphasis>type inference</emphasis> allows a type annotation to be

            Ceylon features an especially elegant approach to generic type argument 
            inference, making it possible to instantiate container types, even 
            inhomogeneous container types, without the need to explicitly mention any 
            types at all.

            <para>
            By limiting type inference to local declarations, Ceylon ensures that all 
            types may be inferred by the compiler in a single pass of the source code. 
            Type inference works in the "downward" and "outward" directions. The compiler 
            is able to determine the type of an expression without considering the rest 
            of the statement or declaration in which it appears.

            A class may be a member of an outer class. Such a member class may be
